# Project2

Description:

Scorn-u-copia is a lightweight and simple app for keeping track of daily nutritional intake, and searching for recipes with detailed nutrition and preparation instructions.  Its purpose is to enable people to be more conscious of what they're eating in order to further their own food based goals.

People using our app should be able to easily find food items and keep track of their nutritional intake. They should be able to find recipes using the search function and save them for later to their profile.
